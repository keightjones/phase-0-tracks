# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the current project you are working on- you use branches to make changes to your current project and then merge it back into the master branch- it also allows multiple people to be working on the project simultaneously.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point that can be used after a significant amount of work has been completed.  A good commit message is detailed and meaningful.
* What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts occur when different people try and merge their respective branches into a master branch and they have different content.
